        <h1>Hiking Tips</h1>
    </div>
    <div data-role="content" class="ui-content">


        <p>The days are getting shorter and the leaves are starting to turn. In warmer sections of the country the
            daytime has become pleasant. It's fall! Some people may hang their boots up until spring, but some of
            the
            best hiking of the year is waiting. There are far fewer people, more wildlife to see, including
            migrating
            birds, and the cool air means you will have an easier time on the trail. Here are ten tips that will
            make
            your time trekking during the fall even more enjoyable.</p>

        <p><strong>Stay comfortable.</strong> This may seem simple in itself but it comes down to two words, "wear
            layers." The morning chill can give way to bright sun and pleasant temperatures. That heavy jacket
            you're
            wearing in the morning can become a liability in the afternoon. Three to four layers and convertible
            pants
            will add flexibility to your trek. As you get warmer you can open and shed layers. If the wind picks up
            but
            the sun is shining, you can wear your shell while removing the insulation. If things get really warm
            convertible pants allow you to zip off the legs, instantly turning them into shorts. What ever you do
            don't
            forget to wear a hat. It can help keep you warm in the morning and cool in the afternoon.</p>

        <p>Hike with the weather. In the fall this goes further than the logic of don't hike during the first ice
            storm
            of the year. Some of the finest hiking can be done in the morning after a sharp, dry cold front brings
            in a
            Canadian high. The air is clean, crisp and clear. If you live in mountainous regions the haze of the
            summer
            will be gone and the visibility will be incredible.</p>

        <p><strong>Get an early start.</strong>Shorter days means you need to maximize every minute on the trail.
            Start
            off early, before the first light so you can start your trek in the first hour of the morning. You will
            be
            rewarded with a symphony of songbirds and bustle of wildlife activity. Remember the sun will set
            earlier, so
            don't get caught out in the dark on the trail.</p>

        <p><strong>Be prepared.</strong>With the fall there is change, and the change is in the weather. Make sure
            you
            are ready for the elements. Rain gear as well as clothing that will protect you from the wind is
            essential.
            If you are going on an extended day hike, especially into higher altitude know the weather forecast and
            carry a weather radio.</p>

        <p><strong>Move quietly.</strong>As the leaves turn and start to fall off the thickets and tangles that hid
            wildlife in the forest disappear. Your stealthy movements will be rewarded with opportunities to see
            many
            animals closer than you normally would. If you live in an area where there are bears or cougars, then
            don't
            follow this advice. As a matter of fact if you are hiking in bear country during the fall you should
            make
            extra noise.</p>

        <p><strong>Leave the insect repellent at home.</strong>Unless you're hiking in a southern climate, most of
            the
            flying, biting, nasty insects have died off or have gone into hibernation. One could easily argue that
            the
            lack of biting insects is the single biggest benefit to hiking in the fall.</p>

        <p><strong>Be spontaneous.</strong>There are many advantages to having flexible plans in the fall. It is
            quite
            possible to have vast sections of a park all to yourself.</p>

        <p><strong>Don't forget the sunscreen and the sunglasses.</strong>Just because it is cooler out doesn't mean
            you
            still can't get a sunburn. Drier air and wind also batters your skin during the fall months. Clearer,
            cleaner air also means brighter sunlight. Lip balm is also helpful if your lips get chapped easily.</p>

        <p><strong>Eat some food.</strong>Nibbling food as your hiking is like slowly putting coal into a fire, it
            keeps
            the internal furnace running nice and hot. Avoid having a heavy meal before or while on the trail. If
            you
            eat a lot the blood will pool in your digestive system robbing you of body warmth.</p>

        <p><strong>Take a friend on their first hike.</strong>Have a friend that has been asking to go on their
            first
            hike? The fall is the perfect time to do it! No insects, tepid temperatures, no crowds, greater chance
            of
            seeing wildlife, and clear skies all add up to a great first time experience!</p>
